# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack

Based on the brownfield architecture analysis:

**Languages**: Kotlin (2.1.0) with JVM Toolchain 17  
**Frameworks**: Jetpack Compose for TV (BOM 2025.02.00), Android TV Material Components  
**Database**: Room (2.7.2) with Paging 3 integration and DataStore (1.1.6) for preferences  
**Infrastructure**: Hilt DI (2.54), Retrofit + Gson (2.9.0), ExoPlayer Media3 (1.6.0)  
**External Dependencies**: Coil image loading (2.7.0), Pusher WebSocket (2.2.1), ZXing QR codes (3.5.3)

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: 
- Extend existing Room database with new entities (WatchlistItem, WatchProgress, UserPreferences)
- Use Room migrations to preserve existing user data during schema updates
- Maintain existing Paging 3 patterns for large datasets (watchlist, continue watching)
- Leverage existing DataStore patterns for simple key-value storage (language preferences)

**API Integration Strategy**: 
- Utilize existing Retrofit service patterns and network infrastructure
- Extend existing repository interfaces with new methods following established patterns
- Maintain current mock/real data switching via `@Named("isMock")` for development
- Preserve existing authentication interceptor for secure API calls

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: 
- Follow established MVVM pattern with Compose state management
- Integrate with existing `UserStateHolder` for global state management
- Use existing navigation patterns in `App.kt` for new screens
- Maintain current TV focus management and remote control handling

**Testing Integration Strategy**: 
- Build upon existing unit test structure for repository and network components
- Follow current Hilt testing patterns for dependency injection
- Maintain existing mock data patterns for offline development and testing

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- New features follow existing package structure: `data/entities/`, `data/repositories/`, `presentation/screens/`
- Shared components placed in `presentation/common/` following established patterns
- New screens organized in feature-specific packages under `presentation/screens/`

**Naming Conventions**: 
- Follow existing patterns (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for resources)
- Maintain existing repository naming (Repository interface + RepositoryImpl)
- Use existing screen naming patterns (ScreenName + ScreenViewModel + ScreenUiState)

**Coding Standards**: 
- Adhere to existing ktlint configuration and Spotless formatting
- Follow established Hilt injection patterns and module organization
- Maintain existing error handling patterns and result wrapper usage

**Documentation Standards**: 
- Update existing brownfield architecture documentation with new features
- Follow current code commenting practices for complex business logic
- Maintain existing API documentation patterns for new endpoints

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: 
- New features integrate with existing Gradle build configuration
- Maintain current baseline profile generation for performance optimization
- Follow existing ProGuard rules and release build optimization

**Deployment Strategy**: 
- Features deploy through existing debug/release build variants
- Maintain current mock data switching for development environments
- New database migrations tested through existing development pipeline

**Monitoring and Logging**: 
- Extend existing error logging patterns for new features
- Maintain current network request logging and debugging capabilities
- New features use established diagnostic information collection

**Configuration Management**: 
- Language preferences managed through existing DataStore patterns
- API endpoints configured through existing BuildConfig system
- New feature flags follow current development environment setup

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**:
- **Database migration complexity** - Multiple schema changes across 8 epics could create migration conflicts
- **Performance impact** - New features may affect existing app performance on older TV devices
- **API dependency** - Real data integration depends on backend API availability and reliability

**Integration Risks**:
- **State management complexity** - Multiple new features sharing global state could create conflicts
- **Navigation complexity** - New screens and flows may complicate existing TV navigation patterns
- **Backward compatibility** - Extensive changes could break existing user workflows

**Deployment Risks**:
- **Rollout complexity** - 8 epics create complex feature flag and gradual rollout requirements
- **User data migration** - Database changes could affect existing user preferences and data
- **Testing coverage** - Comprehensive feature set requires extensive testing across TV devices

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Phased implementation** - Deploy epics sequentially to minimize integration risk
- **Comprehensive testing** - Maintain existing mock data patterns for reliable testing
- **Rollback planning** - Design database migrations with rollback capabilities
- **Performance monitoring** - Implement performance tracking for new features
- **User communication** - Clear documentation and user guides for new features
