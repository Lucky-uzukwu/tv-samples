# Story 1.5: Resume Watching Progress Tracking - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** WilTV user,  
**I want** to automatically resume movies and TV shows from where I stopped watching,  
**So that** I can seamlessly continue my viewing experience without having to remember or manually seek to my last position.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Video playback progress is automatically saved when user pauses or stops watching content
2. Movie/TV show detail screens show "Resume" button when playback progress exists, "Play" when starting fresh
3. "Continue Watching" row appears on Home screen showing recently watched content with progress indicators
4. Progress tracking works for both movies and TV show episodes with visual progress bars

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing video playback functionality continues to work unchanged
6. New progress tracking integrates with existing ExoPlayer implementation
7. Resume functionality follows existing video player and detail screen patterns

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Progress tracking is covered by unit tests and persists across app sessions
9. No regression in existing video playback or navigation functionality verified
10. Continue Watching row follows existing Home screen row patterns and TV focus navigation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Stories 1.3 and 1.4 implementation:
- Complete watchlist system with visual indicators across all screens
- Home screen with existing movie/TV show catalog rows and focus navigation
- Movie and TV show detail screens with existing Play functionality
- Reactive state management patterns established across ViewModels

### Existing System Integration Context
- **Integrates with:** ExoPlayer video playback, MovieDetailsScreen, TvShowDetailsScreen, HomeScreen catalog rows
- **Technology:** Room database for progress persistence, ExoPlayer playback state, StateFlow reactive programming
- **Follows pattern:** Existing video player integration, Home screen row patterns, reactive state management
- **Touch points:** Video player state management, detail screen UI, HomeScreenViewModel, database persistence

### Technical Implementation Context
**Video Player Integration:**
- Hook into existing ExoPlayer playback events for progress tracking
- Save progress on pause, stop, or playback completion events
- Restore playback position when resuming content
- Use ExoPlayer.Listener interface for playback state monitoring

**Database Integration:**
- Create WatchProgress entity with contentId, userId, progressMs, lastWatched timestamp
- Use Room database patterns similar to existing Watchlist implementation
- Create WatchProgressRepository following established repository patterns
- Implement efficient progress updates to avoid database overhead

**UI Integration:**
- Add "Continue Watching" row to Home screen following existing catalog row patterns
- Update detail screens to show Resume vs Play buttons based on progress
- Add progress indicators (progress bars) to Continue Watching row items
- Follow existing TV Material Design patterns for visual consistency

### Source Tree Context
**File Locations:**
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/data/entities/WatchProgress.kt` - New progress entity
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/data/dao/WatchProgressDao.kt` - New DAO interface
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/data/repositories/WatchProgressRepository.kt` - New repository
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/home/HomeScreenViewModel.kt` - Add continue watching data
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/home/HomeScreen.kt` - Add continue watching row
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/moviedetails/MovieDetailsScreen.kt` - Update Play/Resume button
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/tvshowsdetails/TvShowDetailsScreen.kt` - Update Play/Resume button
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/AppDatabase.kt` - Add WatchProgress entity and migration

**Project Structure Reference:**
- Follow existing `data/entities/` patterns for WatchProgress entity (similar to WatchlistItem)
- Repository follows `data/repositories/` patterns similar to WatchlistRepository
- UI components follow existing Home screen row patterns (MoviesRow, CatalogLayout)
- Database schema follows existing Room patterns with proper migration scripts

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- Unit tests: `wiltv/src/test/java/com/google/wiltv/data/repositories/WatchProgressRepositoryTest.kt`
- ViewModel tests: `wiltv/src/test/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/home/HomeScreenViewModelTest.kt` (extend existing)
- Database tests: `wiltv/src/androidTest/java/com/google/wiltv/data/dao/WatchProgressDaoTest.kt`

**Testing Standards:**
- Use existing JUnit and MockK frameworks from project
- Follow reactive testing patterns with TestCoroutineDispatcher
- Test Room database integration with progress persistence
- Test ExoPlayer integration with mocked player events

**Testing Frameworks:**
- JUnit for unit test structure
- MockK for mocking repositories and ExoPlayer
- Room testing framework for database operations
- Kotlin Coroutines Test for StateFlow testing
- Follow patterns from existing WatchlistRepositoryTest.kt

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test progress saving during various video playback events (pause, stop, completion)
- Test progress restoration when resuming content from detail screens
- Test Continue Watching row data loading and display logic
- Test Resume vs Play button logic on detail screens based on progress existence
- Verify no regression in existing video playback and navigation functionality
- Test database migration for WatchProgress entity addition

### Implementation Approach and Constraints

**Integration Approach:**
- Create WatchProgress entity and repository following existing database patterns
- Hook into ExoPlayer playback events using existing video player integration points
- Add Continue Watching row to HomeScreen using established MoviesRow component patterns
- Update detail screens with Resume/Play button logic based on progress data

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not interfere with existing video playback functionality or performance
- Progress tracking should be lightweight and not affect playback smoothness
- UI changes must follow existing TV Material Design and focus navigation patterns
- Database operations should be efficient for frequent progress updates (batch/debounce)
- ExoPlayer integration must be compatible with existing video player implementation

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Progress tracking integration could impact video playback performance or stability
- **Mitigation:** Use efficient background database operations, debounced progress saving, and thorough testing with various content types
- **Rollback:** Remove ExoPlayer event hooks, database schema migration, and UI modifications

**Performance Considerations:**
- Implement progress saving with appropriate intervals (every 10-15 seconds) to avoid excessive database writes
- Use background coroutines for database operations to prevent UI blocking
- Cache recent progress data to minimize database reads on detail screens
