# Story 2.3: Image Loading Error Recovery - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** WilTV user browsing content with poor internet connectivity,  
**I want** failed poster and backdrop images to show helpful placeholders with retry options,  
**So that** I can still navigate and use the app even when images don't load, and easily retry loading them.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Failed movie/TV show poster images display branded placeholder with movie/TV show title and retry button overlay
2. Backdrop image failures show branded background with content information and manual reload option
3. User profile and cast images show generic avatar placeholder with retry mechanism when loading fails

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing Coil image loading infrastructure continues to work unchanged for successful loads
5. New placeholder handling integrates with existing AsyncImage usage patterns without breaking changes
6. Integration with existing authentication interceptor for image loading maintains current security

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Image error recovery components follow existing TV focus navigation and Material Design patterns
8. No regression in image loading performance or caching behavior for successful loads
9. Placeholder designs maintain consistency with existing WilTV branding and UI patterns

  - [x] Add retry callback mechanism to image components
  - [x] Implement proper TV focus handling for retry buttons and interactions
  - [x] Follow existing error handling patterns for user-initiated retries

  - [x] Verify no regression in successful image loading or caching behavior
  - [x] Test TV focus navigation for image retry interactions

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration Context
- **Integrates with:** Coil image loading library, existing AsyncImage components, AuthenticatedAsyncImage custom components
- **Technology:** Jetpack Compose AsyncImage, Coil for image loading/caching, existing authentication interceptors
- **Follows pattern:** Existing image loading patterns, TV focus navigation, error recovery UI components
- **Touch points:** Image loading components across screens, Coil configuration, authentication interceptor setup

### Current Image Loading Context
From brownfield architecture analysis:
- Custom AuthenticatedAsyncImage for secure image loading with authentication
- Coil library used for async image loading with authentication headers
- Image authentication interceptor for user content security
- AsyncImage components used throughout UI for posters, backdrops, profile images

### Technical Implementation Context
**Image Error Handling:**
- Extend existing AsyncImage usage with comprehensive error handling
- Create composable placeholders that match existing design patterns
- Implement retry mechanisms using existing user interaction patterns
- Maintain current Coil configuration and caching behavior

**UI Integration:**
- Create placeholder components following existing composable structure
- Add retry functionality with proper TV focus handling
- Integrate placeholders seamlessly with existing image display locations
- Follow current Material Design and branding patterns

**Asset Management:**
- Add placeholder image assets to existing drawable resources
- Follow current asset naming and organization conventions
- Create scalable placeholder designs for different screen densities
- Maintain consistency with existing WilTV visual identity

### Source Tree Context
**File Locations:**
- Image components in `presentation/common/` and individual screen components
- AuthenticatedAsyncImage or similar custom image components
- Coil configuration in DI modules or application setup
- Drawable assets in `wiltv/src/main/res/drawable/`
- Authentication interceptor setup in network configuration

### Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Enhanced image error handling could interfere with existing Coil configuration or authentication
- **Mitigation:** Extend existing AsyncImage patterns without changing core image loading infrastructure
- **Rollback:** Remove placeholder components and revert to original AsyncImage usage

### User Experience Goals
- Provide clear visual feedback when images fail to load
- Allow users to retry image loading without losing their place in navigation
- Maintain app usability even with poor network connectivity
- Create branded placeholder experience that feels intentional rather than broken

### Performance Considerations
- Ensure placeholder components don't add overhead to successful image loads
- Maintain existing Coil caching behavior and performance
- Implement efficient retry mechanisms that don't impact overall app performance
- Use lightweight placeholder assets that load quickly
