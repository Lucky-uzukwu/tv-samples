## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- WatchlistRepository available with `addToWatchlist(userId, contentId, contentType)` and `removeFromWatchlist(userId, contentId)` methods
- `isInWatchlist(userId, contentId)` provides reactive Flow<Boolean> for button state
- WatchlistItem supports both "movie" and "tvshow" content types
- Complete Hilt dependency injection configured

### UI Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-for-feature-development.md#ui-layer-patterns]
- Reusable UI components in `common/` package
- Screen composables with ViewModel integration  
- State management via StateFlow and collectAsStateWithLifecycle
- TV-specific focus handling and navigation
- Custom theming for TV displays

### Component Patterns
[Source: architecture/source-tree-and-module-organization.md#project-structure-actual]
- **Reusable Components**: Located in `presentation/common/`
- **Screen Integration**: Components integrated into `presentation/screens/` composables
- **ViewModel Pattern**: State management with Hilt injection
- **Focus Management**: TV-specific focus handling with FocusRequester

### Existing Button Integration
Based on code analysis of MovieDetailsScreen and MovieDetails:
- **PlayButton Location**: Integrated within MovieDetails composable after streaming providers
- **Focus Navigation**: Uses focusProperties for TV navigation (left/right cancelled, up/down configured)
- **Layout Pattern**: Buttons placed in Column with padding(top = 16.dp) 
- **Focus Handling**: FocusRequester integration with onFocusChanged callbacks

### User Authentication Integration  
[Source: architecture/architecture-patterns-for-feature-development.md#state-management-patterns]
- UserStateHolder for authentication state management
- StateFlow for reactive state updates
- Hilt injection for state holders

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-reality.md#current-test-coverage]
- **Test Location**: `wiltv/src/test/java/` for unit tests
- **Current Approach**: Limited unit test coverage, manual testing via Android TV emulator
- **Required Tests**: Component behavior, ViewModel integration, focus navigation
