# Story 2.4: Search Error Suggestions - Brownfield Addition

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** WilTV user encountering search errors or no results,  
**I want** helpful suggestions and alternative search options instead of generic error messages,  
**So that** I can find the content I'm looking for even when my initial search doesn't work.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Search network errors display "Search is temporarily unavailable" with suggestions to browse categories or trending content
2. No search results show "No content found for '[query]'" with alternative search suggestions and popular content recommendations
3. Search query errors provide helpful tips like "Try different keywords" or "Check your spelling" with suggested refinements

**Integration Requirements:**
4. Existing search functionality and SearchRepository continue to work unchanged for successful searches
5. New error handling integrates with existing search screen UI patterns without breaking changes
6. Integration with existing content recommendation systems maintains current data flow and performance

**Quality Requirements:**
7. Search error handling is covered by unit tests with various error scenarios and suggestion logic
8. No regression in existing search performance, results display, or navigation functionality
9. Error suggestions follow existing TV focus navigation patterns and Material Design consistency

- [x] Integrate error suggestions into SearchScreen (AC: 4, 5)
  - [x] Update SearchScreen layout to display error suggestions when appropriate
  - [x] Add navigation from suggestions to browse categories or recommended content

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration Context
- **Integrates with:** SearchScreen, SearchScreenViewModel, SearchRepository, existing content recommendation systems
- **Technology:** Existing search UI patterns, StateFlow for reactive search state, content discovery infrastructure
- **Follows pattern:** Current search screen layout and navigation, existing error handling patterns, content recommendation flows
- **Touch points:** Search screen UI components, search state management, content recommendation integration, navigation patterns

### Current Search System Context
From architecture analysis:
- SearchRepository with both mock and real implementations available
- SearchScreen with search results display and navigation
- Existing search UI patterns for results display and navigation
- Integration with movie and TV show content discovery

### Technical Implementation Context
**Search Error Enhancement:**
- Extend existing SearchScreenViewModel with comprehensive error state management
- Create error-specific suggestion components following existing composable patterns
- Implement suggestion generation logic using existing content discovery infrastructure
- Add navigation from suggestions to existing browse and discovery screens

**UI Integration:**
- Create search error components that integrate with existing SearchScreen layout
- Follow current search result display patterns for consistency
- Implement proper TV focus navigation for error suggestion interactions
- Maintain existing search screen state management and loading patterns

**Content Integration:**
- Use existing content recommendation systems for fallback suggestions
- Integrate with category browsing for alternative discovery options
- Follow current content navigation patterns for suggested alternatives
- Maintain existing performance characteristics for content recommendations

### Source Tree Context
**File Locations:**
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/search/SearchScreen.kt` - Search UI enhancements
- `wiltv/src/main/java/com/google/wiltv/presentation/screens/search/SearchScreenViewModel.kt` - Error handling logic
- Search-related components in `presentation/common/` if they exist
- Content recommendation integration points in existing repository system

### Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk:** Enhanced search error handling could interfere with existing search functionality or performance
- **Mitigation:** Extend existing search patterns without changing core search infrastructure, maintain current performance
- **Rollback:** Remove search error suggestion components and revert to original search error handling

### User Experience Goals
- Transform frustrating search failures into discovery opportunities
- Provide users with actionable alternatives when their searches don't work
- Guide users toward content they might enjoy even when their specific search fails
- Maintain search efficiency while adding helpful fallback experiences

### Content Discovery Integration
- Leverage existing content recommendation systems for alternative suggestions
- Integrate with category browsing for structured content discovery
- Use existing trending or popular content systems for fallback recommendations
- Maintain current content discovery performance and data flow patterns
