**External Dependencies**: Coil image loading (2.7.0), Pusher WebSocket (2.2.1), ZXing QR codes (3.5.3)

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: 
- Extend existing Room database with new entities (WatchlistItem, WatchProgress, UserPreferences)
- Use Room migrations to preserve existing user data during schema updates
- Maintain existing Paging 3 patterns for large datasets (watchlist, continue watching)
- Leverage existing DataStore patterns for simple key-value storage (language preferences)

**API Integration Strategy**: 
- Utilize existing Retrofit service patterns and network infrastructure
- Extend existing repository interfaces with new methods following established patterns
- Maintain current mock/real data switching via `@Named("isMock")` for development
